Responsive Start, a child theme for the Thematic Theme Framework
===============

Responsive Start is a child theme built on the mobile-first approach to responsive web design. This theme is essentially the Responsive Base theme on steroids. It is most useful to those who are working with Sass/Compass, Susy Grids. It uses some new approaches to things I have picked up along the way and I built this to be my starting point to creating child themes for Thematic. It is kind of a power user child theme.

It is intended to work best with the latest version of Thematic 'and' the Thematic HTML5 Plugin.
